# Instructions
0.5. Install python... obviously
1. Install `requests` if you haven't already (pip install requests or pip3 install requests)
2. Run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`. Enter in a year (only years >=2020 will work with downloading) It will attempt to download package manifests, then the files with them.

# TODO
Support for multiple channels (Probably only Mac and Windows though since most channels just have version-none or version-missing)

Download just the latest package

Sort clients if they are Studio, Studio64 or WindowsPlayer
