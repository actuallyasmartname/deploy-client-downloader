# Instructions
0. Install python... obviously
1. Install `requests` if you haven't already (pip install requests or pip3 install requests)
2. Run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`. Enter in a year (only years >=2020 will work with downloading) It will attempt to download package manifests, then the files with them.

# TODO
Support for multiple channels (Probably only Mac and Windows though since most channels just have version-none or version-missing)

Download just the latest package

Sort clients if they are Studio, Studio64 or WindowsPlayer

Make it look less like some sort of debug madness and more user friendly

Clean up and optimize code, it's absolute hell in there and I warn the people who attempt to view it
